title: "Reshaping Viscoelastic-String Path-Planner (RVP)"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/rvp
excerpt: 'We present Reshaping Viscoelastic-String Path-Planner a path planner that reshapes a desired global plan for a robotic vehicle based on sensor observations of the environment. We model the path to be a viscoelastic string with shape preserving tendencies, approximated by a connected series of springs, masses, and dampers. The resultant path is then reshaped according to the forces emanating from the obstacles until an equilibrium is reached.'
