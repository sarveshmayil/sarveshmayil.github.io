collection: publications
permalink: /publication/rvp
excerpt: 'We present Reshaping Viscoelastic-String Path-Planner a Path Planner that reshapes a desired Global Plan for a Robotic Vehicle based on sensor observations of the Environment. We model the path to be a viscoelastic string with shape preserving tendencies, approximated by a connected series of Springs, Masses, and Dampers. The resultant path is then reshaped according to the forces emanating from the obstacles until an equilibrium is reached.'
