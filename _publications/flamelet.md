collection: publications
permalink: /publication/flamelet
excerpt: 'A novel hybrid unsupervised cluster-wise regression approach is developed to represent the flamelet tables and speed up the computations in turbulent combustion simulations. The proposed machine learning method utilizes a cluster-wise regression technique where specialized deep neural networks are trained on different parts of the input space.'
