As a robotics engineer with a passion for machine learning and perception, I recently completed my MS in Robotics at the University of Michigan, where I worked on problems across the robotics autonomy stack, from state estimation to planning and control.

Previously, I worked as a ML/Perception Intern at RRAI, where I integrated state-of-the-art object detection and image segmentation models to achieve simultaneous semantic segmentation of image and lidar data, which has become a focal point for their data and model scaling efforts. I have strong skills in Python, C++, and ROS, and I enjoy working on projects that involve computer vision, deep learning, and robotic manipulation.
