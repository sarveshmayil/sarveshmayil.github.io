As a graduate Robotics student at the University of Michigan, I have a strong background in perception, machine learning, and controls. Additionally, I have a fundamental understanding of physical systems and kinematics from my time as a Mechanical Engineering student at Texas A&M University. My interests lie in leveraging advancements in deep learning to solve challenging perception and control tasks for robotics.
